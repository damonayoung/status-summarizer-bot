# Weekly TPM Status Meeting - Week of Oct 21-25, 2025

## Monday Stand-up (Oct 21)
- Engineering team completed API v2.0 migration, deployed to staging
- Database indexing improvements showing 40% query performance gains
- Sarah (Backend Lead) flagged potential memory leak in user service - investigating
- Frontend team blocked on design assets for dashboard redesign - waiting on UX team
- DevOps rolling out new monitoring infrastructure across all services

## Product Planning Session (Oct 22)
- Reviewed Q4 roadmap with Product, PM wants to prioritize:
  1. SSO integration (enterprise customers demanding this)
  2. Advanced analytics dashboard
  3. Mobile app notifications refactor
- Scope discussion: Agreed to descope real-time collaboration features to Q1 2026
- Product wants to move up launch date for v0.2 to Nov 15 (was Nov 30)
  - Engineering pushback: needs at least 3 weeks for proper testing
  - Compromise: Soft launch Nov 20 with feature flags, full rollout Dec 1
- New feature request from Sales: bulk import capability for enterprise clients
  - Added to backlog, not committed for this quarter

## Engineering Deep Dive (Oct 23)
- SSO Integration Status:
  - SAML implementation 80% complete
  - OAuth2 providers (Google, Microsoft) fully tested
  - Risk: Okta integration delayed due to API changes on their end
  - Mitigation: Implemented feature flag system to release other SSO providers first
  - Timeline: Google/Microsoft SSO ready for Nov 1, Okta pushed to Nov 15
- Performance Testing Results:
  - Load testing shows system handles 10K concurrent users (target was 8K)
  - Database replication lag under load needs attention
  - Recommendation: Add read replicas before Black Friday traffic spike
- Technical Debt:
  - Legacy API endpoints still in use by 3 major clients
  - Deprecation plan needed - coordinate with Customer Success
  - Estimated 2 sprints to fully migrate clients

## Risk Review (Oct 24)
1. Infrastructure Costs:
   - AWS bill up 25% month-over-month due to increased logging
   - Action: DevOps to implement log rotation and retention policies
   - Owner: Mike (DevOps Lead), Due: Oct 31

2. Dependency Vulnerabilities:
   - Security scan flagged 3 critical CVEs in third-party libraries
   - 2 already patched, 1 requires code refactor
   - Action: Security sprint next week to address remaining issues
   - Owner: Security team + Backend, Due: Nov 3

3. Talent/Capacity:
   - Two senior engineers interviewing at other companies
   - Backfill recruiting in progress but taking longer than expected
   - Impact: May need to deprioritize non-critical features if we lose headcount
   - Mitigation: HR fast-tracking candidates, retention conversations ongoing

4. Third-party API Rate Limits:
   - Approaching rate limits on payment gateway during peak hours
   - Risk: Could impact checkout flow during holiday season
   - Mitigation: Negotiating higher tier with vendor, implementing request queuing
   - Owner: Backend team, Due: Nov 1

## Stakeholder Sync (Oct 25)
- Customer Success Team Feedback:
  - 5 enterprise clients requesting white-label options
  - Support tickets down 15% after recent UX improvements
  - Feature request: Better admin controls for user management

- Operations Team:
  - Database backup process now fully automated
  - Disaster recovery drill scheduled for Nov 8
  - Monitoring dashboard showing 99.97% uptime this month

- Sales Team:
  - 3 major deals pending, waiting on SSO feature
  - Competitor analysis shows we're behind on mobile features
  - Request for technical sales support on upcoming enterprise pitch

- Executive Leadership:
  - CEO wants monthly metrics dashboard showing engineering velocity
  - CFO concerned about infrastructure cost trends
  - COO requesting process improvements for faster feature delivery
